			<p>Want to know more about me? Let me take you on a little 
				journey about my education and professional experience so 
				far. I promise you it will not take long!...
			</p>
			<div class="wot-block-horiz">
				<div class="text-left">
					<p>It all started with a degree in Management Informatics 
						obtained in Universidade Lusófona de Humanidades e 
						Tecnologias (Lisbon). The objective for me at the time with 
						this degree was to get a broad view on the connection 
						between the computer science world and the management of 
						the companies. Because of this, the degree had a nice 
						balance between the technical computer science subjects 
						(like programming languages, data bases, operating systems, 
						etc.) and the management subjects (like accounting, 
						management tools, etc.). It was also with this degree that 
						I had my first connection with the Web Development world, 
						doing an End of Course project on how we could use a CMS 
						software and tweek it to give more accessibility on websites 
						to handicapped people.
					</p>

				<div class="img" style="background-image:url('images/about/bertrand2.jpg');"></div>	
				<div class="text-right">
					<p>After this degree, I was starving to have my first 
						professional work experience! So I entered in a 1 year 
						internship at Grupo Bertrand Círculo (Lisbon). This 
						company is known in Portugal for the Bertrand bookstores 
						placed all over the country, with one of them being the 
						oldest bookstore in Portugal, located in Chiado, Lisbon. 
						My role there as an intern was to investigate and test a 
						method to help the bookstore employees on better 
						understanding new developments lauched in the softwares 
						in wich they work daily, or just to help the recently hired 
						persons to have a platform where they could learn the basics 
						of their job first. In general, Bertrand wanted an 
						interactive E-Learning platform for their workers. So my 
						job was to first investigate some E-Learning software 
						solutions on the market, test them, and decide with the 
						company the best one to buy. Then, I went to the bookstores 
						to gather and understand the main activities of the employees, 
						and draw this processes in simple workflows. 
					</p>
					<p>
						From here on, 
						the fun part started and the challenge was to build interactive 
						E-Learning courses for the employees! The main process of an 
						E-Learning course wanted by the company was to first record a 
						vídeo with an experienced person on the subject it was being 
						teached, and then build a simulation of the teached process for 
						the people to test what they leaned. In the end of the 
						internship, I passed all my know how to the company so they 
						could continue the work on the E-Learning platform, as this 
						was mainly an individual project. This experience was very 
						fun, and it was a good way to start understanding how a 
						medium sized company works.
					</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<div class="wot-block-vert">
				<div>
					<p>Finishing the internship, I received the oportunity to 
						enter in a small IT consultant company called Teksajo, 
						which worked closely with Grupo Bertrand Circulo. Their 
						job was do develop new functionalities in the 2 main 
						softwares used by Bertrand: the “front store” application 
						used in the bookstores to do all the selling operations 
						with the clients, and the “back store” application used 
						in the bookstores and headquarters of Bertrand to do the 
						back-end operations, like accounting and orders processing 
						to the publishing companies. My role in Teksajo was to 
						work on the development and support of this 2 softwares 
						used by Bertrand. 
					</p>
					<p>In the “front store” I had a more 
						functional approach, doing the requirements gathering 
						and construction of functional documents with new 
						developments to be made. I also had the role to test the 
						received developments from the technical team, and to 
						follow the user tests in Bertrand. By the other hand, on 
						the “back store” software I had a more technical approach, 
						doing a lot of technical development and coding. This 
						software was based in the IBM AS/400 system, and the 
						programing language used to code there was RPG. Getting 
						the hang of the RPG language was a real challenge, as 
						this was an old programming language that is not teached 
						anymore in schools! I stayed in Teksajo for 2 years, and 
						this was by far the place where I learned more technically 
						and functionally.
					</p>
				</div>	
				<div class="img" style="background-image:url('images/about/as400.jpg');"></div>	
			</div>
			<p>After Teksajo, I entered in a new project on a diferent IT 
				consultant company called Agap2. This was a much bigger 
				company from what I was used to, and the project was to work 
				as a permanente consultant in one of the BNP Paribas bank 
				facilities in Lisbon. My role there was to be part of a 
				technical support team on the Wealth Management department. 
			</p>
			<div class="wot-block-horiz">
				<div class="img" style="background-image:url('images/about/bnp-paribas2.jpg');"></div>
				<div class="text-right">
					<p>The bank used the Olympic software on the AS/400 system for a 
						lot of activities in the financial makets, so my know how on 
						the AS/400 system was crucial for this work. The main acitivity 
						of this support team was to guarantee the first and second line 
						of support to the Olympic application for all the users of the 
						bank using this software in Lisbon, Madrid, London, Jersey Island, 
						Middle East, Geneve and Monaco. This support included the 
						investigation of bugs and errors reported by the users, and also 
						a release management role on new developments launched in Olympic. 
						Because of this, we had to keep a close communication on all time 
						with the AS/400 development team placed in Singapore, and with the 
						implementation team and owners of the AS/400 machine in Geneve. We 
						also had the responsibility to test new software fixes provided 
						by Singapore, and support the user acceptance tests on big 
						releases. 
					</p>	
					<p>I stayed in this project for 1,5 years, and this time 
						was crucial to help me understanding all the workflows and 
						complexity of such a big company like the BNP Paribas bank. 
						Also the challenge of supportting an application with so much 
						users taught me a lot of valuable lessons on stress management 
						situations.
					</p>
				</div>	
			</div>
			<p>It was towards the end of the BNP Paribas project that I started feeling a 
				lack of motivation on the technologies I was working on, and wanted to 
				do the shift to some of the cool things being done on the Web! To 
				achieve this, I decided to leave the AS/400 behind and started a small 
				journey to learn more on the Web Development world so I could then find 
				an opportunity in this area. 
			</p>
			<div class="wot-block-horiz">
				<div class="text-left">
					<p>I started by taking an intensive professional degree specialized 
						in Web Development at FLAG (Lisbon), wich had a mix between 
						front-end and back-end development. I learned the basics on HTML, 
						CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, PHP, and had small workshops on JQuery 
						and CMS (Wordpress). It were 132 hours in total, but all teached 
						in 1 single month, 6 hours per day, so there was not much time to 
						practice and consolidate all the information... 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="img" style="background-image:url('images/about/flag.jpg');"></div>
			</div>
			<div class="wot-block-horiz">
				<div class="img" style="background-image:url('images/about/edit.png');"></div>	
				<div class="text-right">
					<p>To solve this, I decided to take another professional degree, but 
						this time more focused on the front-end development part that I 
						felt in love with! So I took a slightly bigger professional degree 
						on Front-End Development at EDIT (Lisbon). The curriculum on this 
						degree was an introduction to UX/UI, and then a more in depth learning 
						on HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Responsive, JavaScript, JQuery and a workshop 
						on the React framework. We also had a big project where we had 
						teams made with people from diferent courses to work on a real world 
						company briefing, doing all the Branding Strategy, UX/UI and 
						Front-End development.  This degree were 245 hours in total, 12 
						hours per week, so it gave me more free time to practice. 
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p>In the available free time, I took the initiative to do some online courses 
				and tutorials on FreeCodeCamp, CodeCademy, and of course, to do this 
				little portfolio site you’re checking right now! 
			</p>
			<div class="wot-block-vert">
				<div>
					<p>I also spent some of my time on this period volunteering myself in 
						a shelter of abandoned animals to help them in everything I could. 
						Nature and Animal Welfare are 2 very important causes for me, and 
						giving a little help by my own brings me peace of mind and a great 
						joy!
